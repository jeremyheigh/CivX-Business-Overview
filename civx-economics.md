# CivX Economics

### On-Going Operations

It is critical that the economy be able to "care for itself" over time and we should not assume we will get it right through initial distribution. Otherwise, we may run out of steam at some point.

### Token Supply

The CivX Token initial token supply will be set at 300,000,000 tokens. These will be pre-mined and stored in the treasury. It is from that treasury that all allocation tiers will be fulfilled one after the other.

In addition to the initial 300,000,000 tokens, there will be a brief mining period of 30 days. During these 30 calendar days approximately 45,000 blocks will be mined. Each of these blocks will receive a 12 tokens per block reward. The estimated number of blocks that will be distributed during this period is 300,500,000.

In addition to the initial 300,000,000 tokens, there will be staking rewards issued for every block created in perpetuity at one \(1\) token per block. This will be true for as long as the blockchain operates.

### Inflation

Proof of Stake systems like the CivX blockchain generate staking rewards. These are sometimes also called mining rewards. These rewards are denominated in the native token and they are provided for essentially bonding some amount of tokens that a person holds in a hot wallet. A hot wallet is a wallet that is online and connected to the internet while participating in the work of verifying transactions and generating blocks of transactions that get appended to one after the other hence forming the blockchain itself.

We are setting staking rewards such that they will effectively generate an approximate 1% inflationary pressure on the economy over time.

### Token Distribution Plan

We endeavor to place tokens into the custody of as many people as possible as quickly as possible. To do so, we have devised an initial token allocation plan that takes into account as much as possible the contributions of everyone in our community to date.

#### Tier 0 – Founders – 10%

10% of all mined coins will be distributed to the founding members of the Foundation, ExO Works, and the Fastrack Institute for the exceptional roles in the founding of the ExO Network overall. All founders’ tokens will vest and no founder will have more than 2% of overall tokens.

#### Tier 1 – Private – 20%

This tier is set for major participants wanting to access the network via the token.

#### Tier 2 - Liquidity – 20%

The primary goals of this tier is to quickly grow the community of token holders in the community. The people and organizations in this tier have supported our efforts to date in countess ways getting to this point as well.

#### Tier 3 – Fundraising Reserve – 30%

30% of all tokens will reserved for future fund raising needs. The form of any such fund raising is not yet determined.

#### Tier 4 – Operations  – 10%

10% of all mined tokens will be held in temporary escrow and released as needed according to a clear monetary policy that is managed relative to fiscal policy guidelines.

·       Marketing & Promotion

·       Staking for Security Needs for the network

·       Network Consulting Services

#### Tier 5 - The ExO Foundation – 10%

10% will be reserved for future needs of the Foundation to be announced and only toward the general health and wellbeing of the ecosystem as a whole. It's reasonable to think of this acting like a treasury stock.

If any entity from Tier 1-3 do not claim, relinquish or donate their tokens, they will end up in this tier, Tier 4 or 5, for future use by the Foundation to further the purpose of the organization.\]\[1\] and community needs.

### Policies

We strive in fiscal and monetary policy setting to have a light touch but with an eye toward a healthy future for the economy. Due to regulatory matters, we do not allow policy that might break service utility at this time.

### Treasury Management

The issue of treasury management of paramount. We have observed many project take this less than seriously. We take this seriously. All treasury funds from the original minting are held in multi-signature wallets.

Multi-Signature wallets are special types of wallets than cannot be spent from in the absence of explicit approval by at least X of Y signers. It’s much like a multi-signer checking account in that regard.

We have created two types.

·      For shorter term needs 90 days or less, we place funds in 2 of 3 multi-signature wallets.

·      For longer term funds we place funds in 3 of 5 multi-signature wallets.

This method is also our preferred method for the management of any tokens that need to be released over time if that is the case. In those cases, it’s a 2 of 3 signature wallet with one of the three being the eventual token holder.
