# Executive Summary

### Executive Summary – The CivX Economy

We are creating the CivX \(exponential civilization\) economy to support the activities of the global ExO Movement . The ExO Foundation\(“ExF”\) will be the initial custodian and curator of this new economy. The ExO Foundation is a public benefit corporation with the massive transformative purpose to

_**Migrate Society to Abundance**_

We are bootstrapping a Minimum Viable Economy\(“MvE”\) to provide tools to accelerate this process. It will be our primary objective to support this nascent economy such that it grows until achieving economic escape velocity \(EEV\). At the point of EEV the CivX Economy will have achieved a sufficient scale and level of transactions to financially support and invest in itself as needed. It is also at this moment, when the economy becomes sovereign, that the beginnings of truly distributed governance can begin. We will create the necessary open and community-engaged governance to support the long-term viability of the economy. Another key objective is to create a stable and well managed economy that will persist over time.

Our MvE is designed to support the ExO Community at large. The community is made up of people, organizations, cities and other partners. The people, through their own actions and those of their organizations, will be contributing to the **migration of society to a civilization of abundance**.

A common unit of exchange in the CivX economy is the CivX Token. It will be a store of value, a unit of transaction, and a medium of exchange. The CivX Token will support the ongoing provisioning and consumption of services in the community. Such services will include ExO Works [Sprints](https://exo.works/exo-sprint/)/[Inspire](https://exo.works/exo-workshop/), Fastrack Institute [Fastracks](https://fastrackinstitute.org/about/), [ExO Speakers](https://leade.rs/speaking-topic/exponential-organizations/) Talks, [ExO Lever](https://www.exolever.com/), ExO Conferences, Partner provided education, and more. In other words, there is already a vibrant and growing economy in place. We've spent three years building this economy in preparation to launch the CivX token. This token will only augment the ability of all the actors within that economy to exchange value with one another over time.

The CivX Token will create a set of economic incentives that provide for long term sustainability of the ecosystem as a whole.

The ExO ecosystem, have already created significant economic value for many years. For example:

* Two service organizations, [ExO Works](http://www.exo.works/) and [Fastrack Institute](http://www.fastrackinstitute.org/) that have deployed over 20 successful projects with an aggregate value in the millions of dollars. These organizations have stated their intent to offer services to the community in exchange for CivX tokens.
* We have approximately 250 ecosystem consultants and coaches and interconnections of 1000’s of people and organizations the overall ecosystem

Other blockchain backed networks have attempted to launch tokens first and then build the community or generate demand. We have done the opposite. We have a thriving community, significant demand, and proven points of execution on the utility of the network. We have built a thriving ecosystem of organizations, strategic partners, and people. This is a key differentiator for what we are building. We have created the CivX Economy, its native digital asset, the CivX Token, and the supporting blockchain technology for the economy. This will be powerful set of tools for the ecosystem and a tie that binds the community together in a myriad of productive ways.

The CivX Economy’s parent organization, the ExO Foundation, operates in a relatively decentralized economic model, similar to a small city. This gives us powerful new tools.
