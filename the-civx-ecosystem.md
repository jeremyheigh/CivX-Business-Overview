# The CivX Ecosystem

### The CivX Ecosystem

We have the good fortune to have the collective networks of many people, organizations, and cities helping us to build our ecosystem \(Fig. 2\). In this section, we detail some of these in an attempt to show the scope of what we are working to achieve even though we are just at the beginnings of this journey.

### Cities

The Fastrack Institute will be a pioneering and primary user of this new blockchain and economy. It will accept CivX Token as payment and use the CivX Token to pay some suppliers. It will act also as a gateway for transfer of local fiat payments to CivX Token in the cities in which it operates. This will effectively place Fastrack Institute cities on the blockchain as something called a staking node. A way to think of this is that the cities node on the blockchain is a virtual representation of the city in the CivX blockchain space. This allows the city to enter into and participate in the CivX economy and transact using the CivX Token.

Cities can earn rewards and tokens while they stake. Cities may use tokens to commission Fastracks for their city. We believe this can be a way for disadvantaged cities to enter the global economy regardless of local economic conditions.

### Organizations

Figure 2- The ExF EcosystemExO Works Inc. will be another pioneering user of the CivX economy. It will accept the CivX Token as payment for ExO Works Sprints and related services from large corporations. This allows its clients to enter into and participate in the CivX economy and transact using the CivX Token.

### Network Organizations

Other organizations that are active participants in the CivX economy will be able to commission Sprints from ExO works or commission Fastracks for their city or use the token to acquire services from other participating economy members. Examples of this are almost any company that chooses to work with and use the CivX token.

### Strategic Ecosystem Partners & Ecosystem Partners

Partnering with entire other ecosystems will be advantageous to facilitate the rapid growth of the CivX economy.

A current partial list, for demonstration, of initial supporting partner organizations is:

**ExO Works** – an advisory firm that conducts 10 week ExO Sprints inside legacy organizations designed to implement invention, innovation, and creativity.

**Fastrack Institute** - a 501\(c\)3 non-profit organization that accelerates technology into society by finding holistic approaches to solving problems, with a focus on large urban centers through 12-16 week sprints.

**Proctor & Gamble** – A global conglomerate that provided early support for the ExO Ecosystem and is a key strategic partner.

**The Rokk3r Ecosystem** - Rokk3r Labs & Rokk3r Fuel ExO - an educational company that teaches the proven methodologies developed by Rokk3r Labs through co-building companies with entrepreneurs around the globe along with its associated venture capital fund.

**Singularity University** **Ecosystem** – Singularity University is a leading global provider of executive education and leadership training. Their network of local chapters, campuses, and alumni are a valuable partner in our ecosystem.

### Technology Partners

**FluidChains** – A blockchain accelerator that is part-owned and supported by the ExF.

**Stratis** – an enterprise blockchain technology stack upon which are blockchain is based and a company standing behind our project with us.

### ExO Network Members

The ExO Network is a network of approximately 220 trained professionals that work to help organizations and cities become exponential. They operate as free agents today. The plan is to grow that network to approximately 2000 in 2018. Network members will have the option to receive CivX tokens as a complementary currency for services rendered. This allows any ExO Network member to enter into and participate in the CivX economy and transact using the CivX Token.

### The ExO Community at Large

Network Members can use the tokens they earn for in network services or trade for other tokens. This allows any ExO Community member to enter into and participate in the CivX economy and transact using the CivX Token.

### The ExO Foundation

The ExO Foundation Inc. \(“ExF”\) is a public benefit corporation. Its massive transformative purpose is **migrate civilization to a society of abundance**. One of the ExF’s primary purposes will be to successfully create and facilitate the CivX  economy. It will have the mandate to, over a reasonable period of time, transition some or all of the economic governance to the CivX economy community.

### Token Holders

CivX token holders are anyone who acquire the token in any way including at offering time to accredited investors and investors abroad. This allows any CivX token holder to enter into and participate in the CivX economy and transact using the CivX Token.

### Token Exchanges

 Token Exchanges are trading exchanges that we intend to list our token on for trade in the open market eventually. No date has been formally set but some discussions have begun.
